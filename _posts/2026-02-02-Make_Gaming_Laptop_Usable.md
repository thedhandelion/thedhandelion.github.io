# The Boring Bit Where I Have a Chat

I think one of the most humiliating feelings is being sat in a lecture hall, minding my own business and taking notes on my laptop, when, suddenly, the laptop's fans ramp up to max speed and I watch, in a state of awe (alongside all the other students), as the laptop just takes off towards the ceiling...

...Only for the battery to die after 6 seconds and crash back onto the desk, all my peers pointing and laughing as I run out of the room, laptop clutched under my arms, blinded by the tears in my eyes, then I slip on a banana peel and suddenly all my clothes are gone and my teeth are falling out and I try screaming but I can't make any noise and I'm trapped and everything is dark and scary and I ask myself "what sort of nightmare is this?!"...

Alas, it was no nightmare, but the average Monday feeling during my university lectorials (well, for the first few months anyway). Never a day went by when my £430 HP Pavilion gaming laptop decided _not_ to imitate a [TU-95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-95) and then proceed to call it a day after 20 minutes of note-taking, punishing me for not bringing the bulky charger. Then, I sit there mindlessly (I mean eagerly, of course...) listening to the lecturer preach their magical technical words I pretend to understand, wondering how on earth everyone else's £150 notebooks can just breeze through a full day of lectures and still have enough juice for a midnight Netflix-binge before it packs up and demands a recharge. 

Look, I get my bargain (especially in 2023) gaming laptop has a 15.6" 144hz display, a Ryzen 5 5600H 6C/12T 3.3GHz processor, a GTX 1650 and 16GB 3200MHz RAM, not to mention an LED keyboard (green, of all colours, but it's okay because I colour-themed it to [Zygarde](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Zygarde)), and they have a baby little laptop with no specs and no personality ([Eevee](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Eevee), in comparison), so of course their batteries will last longer, but surely, when my laptop is running Word, it shouldn't be sat using up all its resources for it, right? I'll illustrate with a graph I made using MS Paint (it took roughly 80% of my laptop's battery life to make this):

Before starting university, 200 miles away from my hometown, I figured there was no chance I was going to be lugging my big fat computer back and forth, especially as all my visits home would involve coaches and trains. So I needed a laptop powerful enough for both gaming and running virtual machines (sometimes two or three at once), which is where this laptop really shined for me! I just wished that it could last a blooming hour on battery with a Word document and a hundred prayers... a pain in the bum, to say the least.

Thankfully, however, I'm a nerdy nerd and I did some silly techy stuff to get it to actually last a few hours when I needed it to, while still being able to switch to 'game mode' when I'm back home with the charger in, ready to spend the next 2 hours mindlessly scrolling through games, realising they don't excite me the way they did when I was younger and life was easier, then opting to watch a movie instead... £500 well spent I reckon.

# The Less Boring Bit Where Stuff Actually Gets Done

After many a researching, these steps were what made my laptop go from lasting {time hours} on battery on an average uni day to {time hours} on battery, doing the same stuff.

## 1. Deactivating the Graphics Card (until it's actually needed)

The greatest thing about gaming laptops is the wonderful presence of a discrete graphics card, but with great power comes great power-usage, making it our greatest nemesis when battery is priority.

For some reason, laptops are also stupid and decide that the graphics card is absolutely 100% without-a-doubt necessary to run a silly little note-taking app and a web browser. This usage alone is what eats up all the battery, so what we need to do is limit the GPU usage to videogames (and other intensive programs such as virtual machines) _only_. This will also stop the GPU fan from ramping up.

### NVIDIA

### AMD

My laptop has an NVIDIA graphics card, so I am very familiar with the steps above. AMD, however, I am yet to have first-hand experience with. Please take the below steps as a rough guide as it's based off information I have found online. 

## 2. Power Plans

Those two words come up all the time when it comes to battery-saving, but the Control Panel's 'Power Options' is our second-best way to save some juice. Firstly, because you can set individual settings to prioritise battery life over performance and, secondly (and more importantly), because you can limit the CPU's clock speed, which both saves power and also helps stop the CPU getting too hot for absolutely no reason and ramping up the fan.

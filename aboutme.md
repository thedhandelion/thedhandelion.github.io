Hi! My name is Dhani. Welcome to the About Me page of my blog, which I am sure you will find very fascinating, indeed.

## (A little bit of) Background Info

Hi :)

## Interests
### Films

While I certainly love my computery stuff, something else I could talk forever about (honestly; do your best to _not_ get me started) are films.

I found a love for watching movies during lockdown (2020), in which I decided to watch all of the MCU movies in [chronological order](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/marvel-movies-in-order/), this was because I went to see Avengers: Infinity War at the cinema with my boys (otherwise known as 'lads' or, more formerly, 'friends') a couple of years prior, even though I'd never even watched a single Marvel movie. Needless to say, I had no idea what was going on, nor did I really care, but at least I got to hang out with my lads (otherwise known as 'boys', or, more formerly, 'friends').

After having watched through those, and enjoyed (most of) them, I wanted a new project. This time, I decided to watch through the [Top 250 Movies on IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/) (spoiler alert: I haven't done it yet). I made a pretty big dent in it, too, as well as finding a plethora of other movies I fancied watching, which is where my love for cinema really kicked in. 
I had started rating all of the films I had watched, both to keep track of what I had seen, but also to keep track of what I had liked. Then again, even if I looked at a random list of films, I'd know which ones I have and haven't watched, as well as having a pretty good guess on what I rated them, too. 
- By the end of 2021, I had rated 242 titles in total (including 2020 ratings), 77 of which were on the Top 250. 
- 2022, however, was my strongest year for film-watching, in which I had rated a further 217 films, 80 of which were on the Top 250.
- Things had slowed down in 2023, which is, incidentally, the year I started university. 119 new ratings in total, 31 of which were on the Top 250.
- I rated 11 **new** movies in 2024, only a handful on the Top 250. _New_ is the keyword here, as this is also the year I got myself a pretty girlfriend and I forced her to watch all my favourite movies, so there was less time for progress, especially considering the busy-ness of uni.
- A similar situation in 2025, seeing 49 new ratings, 9 of which were on the Top 250. 

As of writing (06.02.26), I have rated a total of 643 titles on IMDb, and 208 of the Top 250 (and only two off the Top 100 in its entirety). If you're weird and interested, here is all my [My Film Ratings](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur124805697/ratings/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk), which I have never, ever, made available to anybody else, so consider yourself lucky (or, actually, I suppose pretty unlucky). 

Here are my Top 10 Movies of all time, if that's a little easier to digest (and, again, if you're weird and interested):

10. [Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120735/)
9. [See No Evil, Hear No Evil](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098282/)
8. [Puss in Boots: The Last Wish](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3915174/)
7. [Blade Runner: The Final Cut](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/)
6. [1917](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8579674/)
5. [Inception](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/?ref_=rt_t_2)
4. [Django Unchained](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853728/)
3. [Coco](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/)
2. [The Shawshank Redemption](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/)
1. [Paddington 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4468740/)

With a hundred-million-bazillion honourable mentions.

My favourite director, by a long, long shot, is Christopher Nolan. I have watched every single one of his movies (alongside Tarantino), each one holding a special place in my heart, and I could talk for donkey's years about how much I love each of them.

The oldest movie I have watched is Buster Keaton's [Sherlock Jr.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015324/), released in March 1924! 
The worst movie I have ever watched is [Evan Almighty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413099/)
